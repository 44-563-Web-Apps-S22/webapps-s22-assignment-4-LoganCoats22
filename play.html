<h4><div class="name">TOI.</div></h4> 
<div class="direction">(_not recognising_ CLÉANTE).</div> 
<div class="speech"><div class="TOI">What is it you want, Sir?</div> </div>

<h4><div class="name">CLE.</div></h4> 
<div class="speech"><div class="CLE">What do I want?</div> </div>

<h4><div class="name">TOI.</div></h4> 
<div class="speech"><div class="TOI">Ah! ah! is it you? What a surprise! What are you coming here for?</div></div>

<h4><div class="name">CLE.</div></h4> 
<div class="speech"><div class="CLE">To learn my destiny, to speak to the lovely Angélique, to consult
the feelingsf her heart, and to ask her what she means to do about
this fatal marriage of which I have been told.</div></div>

<h4><div class="name">TOI.</div></h4> 
<p>
    <div class="speech"><div class="TOI">Very well; but no one speaks so easily as all that to Angélique;
you must take precautions, and you have been told how narrowly she is
watched. She never goes out, nor does she see anybody. It was through
the curiosity of an old aunt that we obtained leave to go to the play
where your love began, and we have taken good care not to say anything
about it.</div></div></p>

<h4><div class="name">CLE.</div></h4> 
<div class="speech"><div class="CLE">Therefore am I not here as Cléante, nor as her lover, but as the
friend of her music-master, from whom I have obtained leave to say
that I have come in his stead.</div></div>

<h4><div class="name">TOI.</div></h4> 
<div class="speech"><div class="TOI">Here is her father; withdraw a little, and let me tell him who
you are.</div></div>


<h3>SCENE II.—ARGAN, TOINETTE.</h3>

<h4><div class="name">ARG.</div></h4> 
<p><div class="direction">(_thinking himself alone_).</div></p> 
<div class="speech"><div class="ARG">Mr. Purgon told me that I was to
walk twelve times to and fro in my room every morning, but I forgot to
ask him whether it should be lengthways or across.</div></div>

<h4><div class="name">TOI.</div></h4> 
<div class="speech"><div class="TOI">Sir, here is a gentleman....</div></div>
